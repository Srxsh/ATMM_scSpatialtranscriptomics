# ATMM_scSpatialtranscriptomics
This repository contains the complete codebase for my project, which integrates scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics from human GBM samples. The project investigates spatial heterogeneity in tumor vascular cell types, employing workflows for data preprocessing, integration, differential expression analysis, and cell-cell interaction assays.
